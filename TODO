Things to get done before the 0.10:
* KAuth support:
  Already a branch in this repository with a working helper, add the helper support to the module + fix bugs!
* LDAP support:
  There is experimental implementation already, make it work! Also Add a LDAP mode in the GUI.
* /etc/gshadow support:
  This file is used by shadow to store secrets about groups, in fact a group can has a password or a list of admins.
  When a group is created it should be added into /etc/group and into /etc/gshadow, like kuser does! Features about group passwords and group admins can be planned for a next release.
* Move it into reviewboard and get it approved
